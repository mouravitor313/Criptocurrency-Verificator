# CriptoChecker

CriptoChecker is a Python script that uses the CoinGecko API to obtain information about cryptocurrencies. It allows you to check the current price and price history of a specific cryptocurrency, as well as see the list of cryptocurrencies supported by the CoinGecko API.

## Running CriptoChecker

The easiest way to run CriptoChecker is to use the executable created with cx_Freeze. This allows you to run the program on any computer without having to install Python or any additional libraries. The program, along with all the files and folders created by cx_Freeze, is available in a .rar file.

To use CriptoChecker with the executable, simply extract the contents of the .rar file and run the `CriptoChecker.exe` file. This will open a window with the program's graphical interface.

## Editing CriptoChecker

If you want to edit or modify the CriptoChecker code, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. Additionally, you will need to install the following libraries:

- PySimpleGUI
- requests

You can install these libraries by running the following commands in the terminal:

```
pip install pysimplegui
pip install requests
```

Once you have installed Python and the required libraries, you can run and edit the `criptochecker.py` script using your preferred code editor.

## How to use

In the main window of CriptoChecker, you can enter the ID of the cryptocurrency you want to check (e.g., "bitcoin") and the desired conversion currency (e.g., "usd") in the corresponding text inputs. Then click on the "Check" button to check the price and price history of the chosen cryptocurrency.
